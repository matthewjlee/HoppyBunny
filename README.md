# HoppyBunny
MakeSchool, Intro to CS HoppyBunny Project

One of my first iOS apps! Swift has actually been quite enjoyable to learn, and I think that I've made quite a bit of progress over the past couple days. This one is called HoppyBunny, which is basically a FlappyBird clone. It implements a lot of cool things that I've learned about how Apple designed their language. For example, SKSprites, SKNodes, CGPoints, Z-coordinates, PhysicsKit (that blew me away doe), and a lot of other very useful frameworks that Apple has introduced to make coding a tad bit easier. I'm quite happy with the finished product and how much I've learned over the past couple days.

The game in action:

Some things to work on in the future:
Make the clouds and crystals in the background scroll along with the bunny
Implement an actual start menu
and...
not suck at this game huahuahua
