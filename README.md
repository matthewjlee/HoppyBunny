MakeSchool, Intro to CS HoppyBunny Project

One of my first iOS apps! Swift has actually been quite enjoyable to learn, and I think that I've made quite a bit of progress over the past couple days. This one is called HoppyBunny, which is basically a FlappyBird clone. It implements a lot of cool things that I've learned about how Apple designs their language. For example, SKSprites, SKNodes, CGPoints, Z-coordinates, PhysicsKit (that blew me away doe), and a lot of other very useful frameworks that Apple has introduced has definitely made coding this a way sweller experience. I'm quite happy with the finished product and how much I've learned over the past couple days.  

I am especially proud of understanding this tutorial through 100% haha. Make School has terrific material online, and it's very easy to follow. I am really proud of building this app ground-up (with the help of a few Swift files and assets), and this tutorial really wowed me. If you want to get a taste of what building an iOS game from scratch is like, I highly recommend finding this project on the "Intro to CS" track under iOS Development. 

The game in action:

Some things to work on in the future:  
Make the clouds and crystals in the background scroll along with the bunny  
Implement an actual start menu  
and...  
not suck at this game huahuahua
